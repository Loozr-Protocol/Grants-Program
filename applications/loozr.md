## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview 

**Loozr** is a decentralized investing and music streaming platform on Web 3.0 

It enables musicians to tokenize their profile/brand, music (audios & videos); allowing fans to buy, sell, trade, stream and promote these tokens directly in real-time on the blockchain while also sharing streaming earnings with holders.

**Products:**

Six Key Components Powering the Loozr Ecosystem;

1. **Music Token Launchpad:** Artists, labels, DJs, and producers can instantly launch their tradeable $SONG and $PROFILE tokens on the blockchain without requiring any prior knowledge of cryptocurrencies.
2. **Audio/Video Streaming**
3. **Music NFT Marketplace:** Leveraging the Loozr ecosystem as a tool to increase music NFTs for music sales, ownership transfers and stream revenue.
4. **$MOMENT (SocialFi):** An open social platform for livestreaming and content monetization - e.g recording sessions, freestyles, tours, live sessions, covers, etc.
5. **Offline NFT Debit Card:** Non-fungible pre-tokenized profiles are utilized in merchant outlets like debit cards to make purchases of their choosing.
6. **LOOZRverse** - XR Music World [Off-Chain PoC  https://yobozorle.github.io/loozr_meta/]: Create your world, sell, trade, lands, NFTs, host events, play to earn, adventure, etc

Whereas, the **LOOZRverse** is among the component features of the Loozr Protocol that gives musicians and music lovers the Metaverse experience; employing 3D gamification, gameplay interactions and in-metaverse minting & rewards, music event hosting and NFT ticketing integrated with the MintBase gateway, and future development of AR, VR, MR; XR Music experience.

We intend to employ Mintbase Modules to facilitate seamless minting of tickets, NFTs and treasury rewards, engage with contents and citizens within the LoozrVerse and perform custom tasks daily. 

Create, explore and trade in the first-ever virtual world owned by musicians and music lovers - LOOZRverse

N/B: Although the Loozr music streaming and fungible tokenization feature is already being implemented and runs independently and directly on the NEAR Protocol by the Loozr team, we are considering integrating with Mintbase on the LoozrVerse feature alone; to hasten the creation of virtual event ticketing, NFT showrooms, and rewards as we improve the off-chain PoC Metaverse.


### Project Details


- PoC/MVP: https://loozr.io 

**Stacks:**
- Smart Contracts: NEAR Onchain Integration, Mintbase API [for LOORverse], Rust

- The music streaming and music token launchpad is already under development on core  NEAR Protocol and is scheduled to go live in August 2022.
- Since Mintbase offers a ready-to-use integration for developers, this enables us and speeds up the creation and implementation of the LOOZRverse, NFT events & ticketing phase of the project, which involves minting and displaying NFTs, selling virtual music NFTs, listing of real world stores and business (especially projects within the ecosystem), and hosting and rewarding concerts.
